## Globoto Reboot Climate App
### Description
Globodo is a mobile application that helps the individuals to detect the type of plastics by using 
the object detection algorithm, in order to encourage them to recycle the plastic bag and turns the 
trash into treasure and rewards for individuals and release the global climate change.

### Globodo operates on three core features: 
* AI plastic detection system
* Geolocation
* Social Platform

To make an effective change to reduce our plastic waste and prevent climate change, there must be an interaction between the consumers of plastic goods and larger organisations (local/federal governments, NGOs, private companies). Globodo uses its core features to provide solutions to both markets.

### Consumers of Plastic Goods:
	Consumers use the AI plastic detection system to recognize which items can be recycled and which cannot. Once these items are scanned, the geolocation system will refer people to places where to responsible recycle the items, rather than disposing of them in the trash. In these recycling centers, people can exchange these for money. 
	A critical feature of the product is the social platform that it creates. Users are able to see how much other members of their community, their country, and the world are recycling through a leaderboard. As the number of items that one recycles increases, they will be able to earn badges to display to others. This can open additional perks and rewards. This incentivizes people, especially children, to recycle by creating friendly competition and rivalry. Over time, this will make people more comfortable with the topic of waste management and make recycling a more social activity.
	People can also use the AI system to sort through waste in order to separate out the plastic which they can return to the recycling facilities for profit. This would help supply a supplementary income to low-income people. 

### Larger Organizations:
	Once consumers use the AI system to scan, their location and number of plastic objects scanned is sent to a server. Over a large number of scans, a heatmap will be able to be generated to recognize areas where plastic waste is being produced the most. This data will allow organisations to target these specific areas with recycling/conservation efforts. 
	For underdeveloped countries, this system will allow the government to find the locations of landfills. In these areas, sanitation infrastructure doesnâ€™t exist so this will allow them to focus their efforts and develop infrastructure in specific areas.

### Scalability

### Waste Management 48 billion dollar industry 

Plastic Currency Integration Wallet (Plastic Bank)
A virtual wallet can be established in the app. Once the plastic is returned to the facilities, they will be able to transfer funds into the user account. This money can be used in partnering supermarkets or stores, or transferred directly into a bank account.
Partnerships
Partnerships with brands (that are plastic producers, such as Coca-Cola) will allow them to be part of the activism and have access to an equally conscious community. In return, it strengthens our brand.
Partnerships with supermarkets and recycling facilities will allow the implementation of the plastic currency wallet and help low-income communities. 
Partnerships with arenas, stadiums, and nature preserve sites allow us to increase brand awareness and reduce plastic wastes in places where it is very prevalent.
Education
Educating children on the importance of waste reduction and responsible recycling creates a future generation of environmentally-conscious communities.

Revenue will be created by selling data visualization features to larger organizations and through sponsorships. The app for consumers will remain free.
Core technology
Globodo operates on three core features: 
AI plastic detection system
Geolocation
Social Platform

### Technical specifics
	iOS app is coded in swift. The Artificial Intelligence used to detect the trash is a convolution neural network trained on the cocoa data set. Trained as an object detector and can classify 80 objects so far.

   For the future, data visualization will be programmed in python using the plotly api. Pandas will be used for database management. We will create a server to manage the data for the location and social network features of the app.

### Minimum viable product 
	Screenshots attached in the presentation. Incorporates the AI, social platform, and geolocation.
